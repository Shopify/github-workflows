Please open an issue for discussion.
It's probably welcome, but our release model of tags and Dependabot discourages workflows that will update frequently.

# I want to change a workflow

PRs welcome!

Once the code has been pushed to a branch in this repository, you can modify your repository to test your feature branch. Example: `uses: Shopify/github-workflows/.github/workflows/scorecard.yaml@my-cool-branch`.

Testing branches does not require a PR, but feel free to open a draft and `@mention` if you'd like feedback.
Ideally PRs will be able to link to at least one example of their modifications running.
